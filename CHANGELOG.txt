17.09.2021: Adjustments for deal 9.3.1
16.09.2021: Specify namespace for boost placeholder _1. Introduction of namespace avoids
		ambiguity and prevents errors with newer boost versions where use without declaration
		of namespace is depreceated.
10.08.2021: Allow filtering of iteration numbers. Now it is possible to only print certain
	    iterations to file, e.g., every n-th time step.
27.07.2021: Updated PDE/Instat/Example8 and added PDE/Instat/Example10 until 12
	    now solving four Benchmarks for fracture propagation.
27.07.2021: Added InterpolatedFEFaceValues 	    
25.07.2021: Added Example for the use of gradient robust methods
21.07.2021: In deal 9.3.0 the hp capabilities in the SpaceTimeHandler classes are
	    now deduced from the finite element given. Thus avoiding unnecessary
	    initialization of the dealii:DoFHandler.
21.07.2021: Added first files for Gradient Robust interpolation - InterpolatedFEValues and
	    corresponding data containers.
14.07.2021: Adjustments for deal.ii 9.3.0 - removing deprecated set_fe calls and
	    updating CMakeLists.txt to use cxx17 instead of cxx11
02.03.2021: Fixes for deprecated functions in deal.ii 9.2.0
10.12.2020: Further adjustments to deal.ii 9.3.0 - The dealii::DoFHandler now detects
	    'hp-capability' from being initialized by a FiniteElement or FECollection.
03.12.2020: CheckGradient and CheckHessian now accept a preinitialized direction dq if the
	    constant c is set to be zero.
15.10.2020: Cleanup of templates for deal 9.3.0, now less
	    case checks for deal 9.3.0 are needed.
15.10.2020: Fixed typos in dealii 9.3.0 update
12.10.2020: Fixes in new code to assert compatibility with deal 8.3
08.10.2020: Fixes in new code to assert compatibility to dealii 8.5
08.10.2020: Removed code-fragments for compatibility to dealii versions prior to 8.3.0
07.10.2020: Removed DoFHandler as template argument for dealii version 9.3.0 as it
	    is no longer needed.
06.10.2020: Fixed SetActiveFEIndex* methods to work with the merged DoFHandlers
05.10.2020: To adjust to the merging of the DoFHandlers, all classes having
	    a DoFHandler as template argument now need an additional template
	    (bool) to indicate if hp-functionality is used, so that the mappings
	    can work correctly.
05.10.2020: Adjustments to deal version 9.3.0. Due to the merging of the DoFHandlers
	    no separate DoFHandler for HP is needed - and is no longer supported.
	    To fix the automated selection
	    between Mapping and MappingCollection the DOpEWrapper::Mapping now needs a
	    template argument telling if it is a collection or not. 
27.06.2020: Fixed: FaceDataContainer::GetCenter returns center of face instead of the corresponding element.
	    In Integrator; if at an interface a face term needs to be evaluated neighbor information
	    is also assembled for the evaluation of the face terms.
	    Optimization problems where gradient involves face/interface terms now running without
	    failure due to missing Face/Interface Matrix.
	    Functionals can now evaluate interface terms using also neighbor element information.
22.05.2020: Moved GetStateIndex and GetControlIndex to be protected rather than private
	    to allow access in derived classes
18.05.2020: Updates for dealii 9.2
04.05.2020: Fixed of by one error in storage of functional values for InstatPDEProblems
08.04.2020: Adjustments to 'OSX Terminal' for test scripts
08.04.2020: Adjustments for warnings given by gcc 4.9
23.02.2020: Added new refinement container RefineByGeometry which can be used to drive
	    mesh refinement based on geometric features of the domain, i.e., the location
	    of the respective elements. An example has been added to
	    Examples/OPT/StatPDE/Example4, where now elements are refined if they lie on the
	    boundary.
07.02.2020: Fixed bug in PointConstraintsMaker prohibiting the use of pointconstraints at zero.
19.01.2020: Fixed bug in Integrator::ApplyInitialBoundaryValues. Now this function works correctly
	    with hanging nodes.
16.01.2020: Moved counter for time-step to last position in file name, so that iterating in
	    visualization tools gets easier
25.10.2019: Fixed bug in ReducedProblemInterface_Base::GetTimeFunctionalValue
27.09.2019: Failure of the Newton methods now cleans all integrator data prior to
            throwing an exception. Thus a recomputation can be setup without
	    first cleaning all data.
03.09.2019: If code runs in parallel using MPI, the outputhandler of the rank == 0
 	    process writes the log and console output.
21.08.2019: Fixed bug in SpaceTimeVector; now the behavior 'store_on_disc' also works
	    for optimization problems in the adjoint loop.
	    Further Examples/OPT/InstatPDE/Example2 now uses this StorageBehavior.
16.08.2019: Fixed ipopt and snopt interface after adjustment to deal.ii 9.1.1.
05.08.2019: Adjusted DOpE to compile with deal.ii 9.1.1.
05.07.2019: Added possibility to add UserDomainData to instationary and optimization problems.
	    For instationary problem AddUserTimeDomainData can be used to add time dependent
	    data.
10.05.2019: Added info on rebuilding matrix to output of Newton solvers for PDEs.
24.04.2019: Added error estimation to PDE/StatPDE/Example16, to show how to
            use precomputations to evaluate non-elementwise quantities needed
	    in error estimation for VIs.
22.04.2019: Added Example PDE/StatPDE/Example16 to show how to solve an
	    obstacle problem with Newton's method using a complementarity function.
20.03.2019: Changed PDE/InstatPDE/Example4_TimeSpace to PDE/InstatPDE/Example9
	    showing the use of Rothe-discretization for a 2d heat equation
	    and Residual error estimation.
	    Fixed Bug in Rothe-Spacetimehandler and non-homogeneous Dirichlet-Values
25.01.2019: Update of DWRDataContainer_Base. Now, the container stores
	    Space-Time distributed error indicators. Access to the global
	    space-time summed error indicators can be done via GetError(), GetPrimalError(),
	    GetDualError(), GetControlError() compatible with the access in the stationary case.
	    To access the summed indices at a time-point, previously selected with SetTime,
	    corresponding Get*StepError() methods are available. To access the element-wise
	    indicators (now already without sign!) the method GetErrorIndicators() returns
	    a vector containing the elementwise indicators for each element and time step.
	    The indicators for a particular time-step i can be accessed via operator[i]. 
16.01.2019: -Updated Rothe_SpaceTimeHandler, to fix wrong order of deletes in Destructor
	    -PDEProblemContainer now has a function for adding AuxiliaryVariables which
	     need to be transfered to a different mesh due to a change over a time step.
	    - SpaceTimeVector now has a method to access the values at a given time point
	      interpolated to DoFs at a different timepoint. Further, access to the vectors
	      by GetSpacialVector, now checks (and aborts) if a copy of this vector has been
	      called for and not been previously unlocked.
	    -InstatPDEProblem now correctly handles the possibility of changing meshes
	     in time.
	    -Updated Test for PDE/InstatPDE/Example4_TimeSpace for the new output of the
	     ForwardTimeLoop showing mesh changes in time.
16.12.2018: -Changed DOpEtypes::ControlType to DOpEtypes::VectorAction to
	    allow unification of storage classes.
	    -Updated ControlVector to be based on SpaceTimeVector.
14.12.2018: Added support for error estimation in InstatPDEProblem
13.12.2018: Started work on Rothe space-time-handler:
	    -Adding time_point to all access functions in space-time-handlers
	    -Fixed flipping between int and unsigned for time_points
	    -Added refinement possibility to Rothe space-time-handlers
	    -New class SpaceTimeVector to unify the storage routines of the
	     different vector classes, as StateVector, ControlVector, ...
18.10.2018: Compatibility fixes for deal.ii without Trilinos/MPI and deal.ii v8.5.0
18.10.2018: Merged parallel-dev branch. Including the following changes:
	    -Replaced long if/else sections by a switch.
	    -WriteToFile method moved to spacetimehandler.h, now including parallel output in .vtu
	     format.
	    -ReinitVector in spacetimehandler.h now also for parallel vectors.
	    -Fixed some missing initializations.
	    -ReSizeSpace methods changed interface. Now a variant for block and non-block
	     vectors exists.
	    -Integrator (integrator.h) adjusted to distributed triangulations.
	    -Newtonsolver (newtonsolver.h) adjusted for distributed vectors, by handling
	     ghosted and non-ghosted vectors.
30.08.2018: Updated ReducedSNOPTAlgorithm to be compatible with SNOPT v 7.6
28.08.2018: Added the possibility to conduct precalculation of nodal values in error estimation,
	    such as information if a node is in 'full contact' for error estimation in the obstacle
	    problem. To use this the method NPrecomputedNodalValues() needs to be implemented in an
	    error estimator. The values to be computed must be implemented via the 
	    *AuxRhs methods of the PDE which have been added to the PDEInterface. 
27.08.2018: Updated date in version file.
03.08.2018: Added methods to count neighboring elements to a vertex. With this
	    one can integrate over vertices, e.g., to evaluate the dual finite element
	    basis in vertex based elements.
	    Added potential output of intermediate solutions during the Newton loop to allow
	    for easier debugging.
13.06.2018: Code update for dealii v9.0.0:
	    - Some Examples needed to have 'functional_number_precision' to be set in the tests
	    - In some examples the Manifold induced refinement differed from the previous one
	      from curved boundaries. Now Tests are depending on the deal.ii version in these examples
12.06.2018: Code update for dealii v9.0.0:
	    - fixed deprecated 'HyperBall' by updating the examples to use manifolds.
	    - fixed deprecated 'ZeroFunction' by using 'Functions::ZeroFunction'.
14.08.2017: Removed comparisons with fixed tolerance for zero difference tests, now using relative scaling.
09.08.2017: Implemented first functionality to simulate PDEs on networks. Together with an 
	    example in Examples/PDE/StatPDE/Example14.
07.08.2017: Updated the manual.
01.08.2017: Added developer branch for networks of PDEs
26.07.2017: Added publication to license file.
24.07.2017: Fixed: Unified check for deal.II version.
20.07.2017: Fixed: In one dimensional PDEs, the error estimation failed, because the 
	    1d face-iterator of deal.II does not support the same features as in dimension 2 and 3.
	    Thus the indexing of the faces by face_iterators failed in 1d. This is now fixed.
18.07.2017: Fixed: If control dimension is 0 then the error estimator failed
	    since the higher order interpolation could not be defined.
	    This is now fixed and the interpolation error is set to zero (as
	    there is no interpolation error in 0d.
14.07.2017: Fixed: When solving the PDE fails in (stationary) optimization problems a line search for the optimization
	    is now done.
21.06.2017: Added possibility to evaluate the final-time value of the solution in the functional together with the initial value.
16.06.2017: Fixed: missing cross derivative in initial-values for adjoint_hessian problem.
16.06.2017: Fixed: When considering initial-value control the control could only be accessed 
	    in the initial-time. This has been fixed, so that the control may be used at other times 
	    as well. This is useful if periodicity is to be enforced and initial values need to be compared 
	    with final values.
17.05.2017: Fixed: When special initial-values for the nonlinear iteration are prescribed in 
	    stationary problems these values can now also be written as files.
19.04.2017: Removed description.tex files from Example folders
=== DOPE Meeting on Apr 12-13, 2017 in Darmstadt ==============================
13.04.2017: - Bernhard started working on a phase-field fracture example
	    - Repaired PDE/StatPDE/Example 9 (UMFPACK failed due to 
	      non-unique pressure with INH material)
	    - Added InstationaryPDEProblemContainer. Now Nonstationary PDEs
	      can be run without a fake control. PDE/InstatPDE/Example1
	      has been adjusted to the new possibilities.
	    - Unnecessary template-parameter in the time-stepping schemes
	      removed. The previously needed dopedim can now be avoided
	      using the auto keyword.
	    - All instationary PDE Problems adjusted to new structure.
12.04.2017: - replaced compressed_simple sparsity pattern by dynamic
	      in order to compile with deal.II 8.5.0 version
	    - Updates of documentation: debug/release how to change them
	       * remarks to for the correct installation
	       * svn -> git how to create new examples
	       * changed more svn stuff to git (how to obtain from git)
	       * to use candi for 3rd party 
	    - Added local constraint handling to integrators to allow the use of
	      parallelization. This breaks the old initialization of
	      higherorder-dwr containers (OPT/StatPDE/Example1 and PDE/StatPDE/Example5)
	      the initialization has now to be done in the problemcontainer and no longer
	      in the reducedproblem.
====end of DOPE Meeting on Apr 12-13, 2017 ====================================
31.03.2017: Added assertion for the initial condition to avoid obscure results 
	    if initial conditions have too few components.
08.03.2017: Now initial values in PDE-Newton are possible if
	    Dirichlet-values depend on the control.
04.03.2017: Moved to the git system.
17.11.2016: Augmented the cmake-files. Now, the examples can search for the 
	    dope sources. This means, the example directory can now be stored 
	    anywhere and the DOpE/DOpEsrc directory can be stored somewhere else.
11.11.2016: Cleaned Examples: Paramfiles may no longer have undeclared entries.
11.11.2016: Adapted ParameterReader and autocmake files to deal.II 8.5
25.07.2016: Reordered the hints in the CMakeLists files for 
	    deal.ii. Now the order is
	    cmake-flag -DDEAL_II_DIR, env{DEAL_II_DIR}, ${home}/deal.II
	    So that setting the flags/or the environment variable 
	    always wins against the path.
25.07.2016: Minor changes in the code to be compatible with
	    the use of clang compiler. 
24.07.2016: Added the file problemsdata/adjoint_hessianproblem.h
	    which contains all equation data needed for the
	    solution of the adjoint problem for the
	    evaluation of the reduced hessian.
24.07.2016: Added the file problemsdata/adjointproblem.h
	    which contains all equation data needed for the
	    solution of the adjoint problem.
24.07.2016: Added the file problemsdata/tangentproblem.h
	    which contains all equation data needed for the
	    solution of the tangent problem.
24.07.2016: Cleanup of the OptProblemContainer. Removed the
	    equation code for the subproblems 'adjoint_for_ee' and
	    'state'.
24.07.2016: Added the file problemdata/opt_adjoint_for_eeproblem.h
	    This file contains the pde information for the
	    adjoint problem associated with error estimation for
	    an optimization problem. 
22.07.2016: Added the file problemdata/pde_adjoint_for_eeproblem.h
	    This file contains the pde information for the
	    adjoint problem associated with error estimation for
	    a pde solution. Now PDEProblemContainer is only
	    needed to generate the problems used in stationary
	    PDE calculations.
26.05.2016: Restructured include commands in files now files
	    in DOpEsrc are included with <> brackets and explicit
	    mentioning of the subdirectory
19.05.2016: Evaluation Functionals given as functions of 
	    integrals now also possible for auxiliary (non-cost) Functionals
	    as well as for PDE problems.
19.05.2016: Restructured code from previous updates to 
	    simplify the code layout.
18.05.2016: Updated the instatreducedproblem so that 
	    optimization problems with cost-functionals given as 
	    time integrals of functions of space-integrals are possible.
	    An example is provided in OPT/InstatPDE/Example4
18.05.2016: Updated the pde and functional interfaces. Now both provide
	    the current time and the time-step-size via corresponding
	    GetTime and GetTimeStepSize functions.
17.05.2016: Updated the statreducedproblem so that 
	    optimization problems with cost-functionals given by 
	    functions of integrals -- such as the absolute-value of the
	    drag -- is possible. A corresponding example is available
	    in OPT/StatPDE/Example10		 
11.05.2016: Checking for MPI to avoid errors when using Trilinos
	    versions compiled with MPI.
08.04.2016: Update in the Newton solvers. If the step calculation 
	    fails with a matrix reused from a previous iteration, 
	    instead of returning an error the Newton solvers now repeat 
	    the step with a newly assembled matrix. 
05.04.2016: Providing an interface to the direct solvers of Trilinos
	    via the TrilinosDirectSolverWithMatrix class. The use 
	    is demonstrated in PDE/StatPDE/Example10
04.04.2016: Updated CMakeExamples.txt so that now the static libraries
	    of SNOPT are linked. Using the shared libraries may 
	    provide problems, as shared linking to SNOPT's own libblas
	    gives complications if a system wide libblas is also found. 
01.04.2016: Removed old code from the makefiles. This breaks compatibility 
	    with deal versions prior to 8.0 not using cmake.
01.04.2016: Removed hidden-virtual warnings when compiling with deal.ii
	    version 8.4.0 
31.03.2016: Updated CMake files for the examples. Now CMake fails with a
	    warning if deal.ii is compiled without UMFPACK. 
	    Moreover the Flags for found thirdparty libraries are now 
	    DOPELIB_WITH_SNOPT, DOPELIB_WITH_IPOPT and 
	    DOPELIB_WITH_TRILINOS (for future trilinos incorporation)
31.03.2016: Fixed Bug with NeedInitialState. Now, the initialization is 
	    only performed if the state is still close to zero, i.e.,
	    no previous information has been stored in it. This allows	
	    to reuse iterates above different levels of refinement as 
	    starting value.
30.03.2016: Changed the FaceDataContainer Method GetElementDiameter.
	    Now, as the name suggests, it returns the diameter of the 
	    element - and not of the face as before. With this change 
	    this function also work in 1d where faces are points.
29.03.2016: Added a function `NeedInitialState' to the 
	    PDEInterface. It defaults to false but can be set to
	    true. If true is returned the initial values given to 
	    the problem are used in the stationary case to 
	    initialize the state variable in Newton's method. This
	    can be used if a good starting value is present, or if 
	    zero is a non-feasible value in the Newton iteration. 
16.02.2016: Fixed bug in the CMakeExample.txt file. The search for 
	    additional libraries in ipopt and SNOPT was broken 
	    and always returned true - this is now fixed.
16.02.2016: Adjustments for release of dealii V8.4: removing deprecated
	    function calls.
===============================================================================
25.01.2016: Release of DOpElib 3.0
===============================================================================
03.12.2015: Updated checkwarn.sh to be useful with the deal 8.3.0
	    since the old make-scripts no longer work with the 
	    new cmake system.
03.12.2015: New Example dG-Discretization in a non-stationary setting
	    for the isothermal Euler equations
	    PDE/InstatPDE/Example7
	    Bugfix in integrator needed to allow dG in space 
	    discretizations in time-dependent problems.
02.12.2015: Added support for dG-Discretizations (integration on faces
	    coupling elements) - and corresponding 
	    example PDE/StatPDE/Example13
02.12.2015: Updated Documentation: Removed TeX warnings. Added Thanks to 
	    Christian Goll for his work in the last six years.
19.11.2015: Updated Website - moved website to TU Darmstadt
05.10.2015: Adjusted DOpE to compile with deal.ii 8.3.0
16.01.2015: Added CMake build system for the examples and updated
	    the documentation. Set Version to 3.0 pre.
13.01.2015: Added CMake build system to the library
02.01.2015: Moved the repository to a new home https://svn.dopelib.net
02.01.2015: Fixed a bug, that the norm of the residual in the 
	    ReducedNewtonAlgorithm can get negative due to
	    cancellation errors, aborting the calculation.
	    Now, the calculation is only aborted if the negative 
	    value is too large compared to the requested tolerance;
	    otherwise the iteration is stopped, since the tolerances 
	    are met.
19.12.2014: Fixed Make.global_options in the Examples directory.
	    Now, the linker options are no longer passed to the 
	    creation of the object files but only to linking.
	    This removes spurious Warnings that linking is not done.
19.12.2014: Added support for nonstationary optimization problems with 
	    nonlinear time-derivatives, when access to the state 
	    variable in adjacent timepoints 
	    is needed. These values are accessible unless the problem-type is 
	    "state" via the label "state_i-1" and "state_i+1". 
	    If the problem-type is "state", 
	    "state_i-1" is "last_time_solution" as it always has been and 
	    access to state_i+1 is not possible: 
	        - Don't take future values of the state.  
19.12.2014: The SetTime function in the *Vector classes has been removed 
	    - now SetTimeDoFNumber has to be used. 
	    The functionality of SetTime to interpolate between these values 
	    should not be part of the Vector, but needs to be calculated 
	    outside analog to the nodal-vector and the FEValues object.
===============================================================================
24.10.2014: Release of DOpElib 2.0
===============================================================================
24.10.2014: Add doxygen documentation to website 
24.10.2014: Change private data member notation to trailing underscore 
18.10.2014: Changelog now completely in English
18.10.2014: Executables for the examples are now, by default, 
	    placed in the respective example directory and no longer in a 
	    global bin directory
30.07.2014: Bugfixes for: clang and ubuntu 14.04 
26.02.2014: Support for the ControlVectorBehavior::nostationary has been added
	    to allow controls that vary in time. Added Examples/OPT/InstatPDE/Example3.
26.02.2014: Fixed Bug in nonstationary problems. Up to now, the type timelocal 
	    and timedistributed where not correctly checked for, and it has always been
	    considered to be timelocal. This is now fixed.
28.01.2014: Fixed missing initializations in InstatOptProblemContainer::ReInit.
	    Added temporal refinement (global) to the SpaceTimeHandlers.
	    Added Examples/OPT/InstatPDE/Example2 to demonstrate the 
	    ControlType::stationary.
27.01.2014: Moved the timestepsize from the timestepping scheme into the problem,
	    i.e., the scheme has to be written for stepsize one. This allows 
	    to handle timedependent pdes with time independent functionals automatically
	    by scaling only the appropriate terms with the stepsize.
	    Additionally, the FunctionalInterface::NeedTime has now the default
	    return value true to avoid the implementation of this function in stationary 
	    problems.	    
	    Third, the ControlType is now a DOpEtype and no longer a std::string.
02.01.2014: Added the StateVector behavior only_recent where only the 
	    spatial vector of the current timestep exist in memory. 
	    An example is included in PDE/InstatPDE/Example2
29.12.2013: Added DOpEType::VectorStorageType for the vector behavior in 
	    the *Vectors replacing the std::string.
===============================================================================
17.12.2013: Release of DOpElib 1.0
===============================================================================
13.12.2013: 1) description.tex has been rewritten
	    2) contents.tex especially OPT examples
	       and PDE/Instat/Example2 have been updated
	       In particular, explained how optimization problems are 
	       solved using DOpE (_U _UT _UTT Terme, constraints, etc)
	       OPT/StatPDE/Example1 content.tex is now very detailed
            3) PDE/Instat/Example2 extended to FSI with biharmonic mesh
	       motion.
13.12.2013 Code Cleaning in the examples:
		Unified look of the code, deleted unnecessary includes, give
		localpde instead of PDEInterface as template etc., typedefs instead
		of defines for the abbreviations
09.12.2013 Renamed Functions: 
	   FunctionalInterface::Value*
		now is FunctionalInterface:ElementValue*/ 
	   All functions named *cell* are now called 
	   *element*.
06.12.2013 Doxygen documentation finished:
	   Except for self explanatory functions all other
	   should have a doxygen comment.
05.12.2013 Unused parameters should now all be placed in a comment.	
	   All occurrences of the __attribute__((unused)) directive 
	   have been removed.
11.09.2013: 1) PDE and OPT StatPDE code cleaned
	    2) Updated doxygen docu
	    3) Experimental Example to develop use of MG-Solver
	    4) Documentation in PDE/StatPDE
09.05.2013: DESCRIPTION: Template - parameters reworked:
	    Changes to the user interface:
	    1) template<typename [FE|DOFHANDLER]> is now template<template<int,int> class [FE|DOFHANDLER]. 
               So instead of, f.i., dealii::DoFHandler<2> you have to specify dealii::DoFHandler as a 
               template parameter.
	    2) ReducedProblemInterface has lost both dim-template-parameters, and derived classes are adapted.
	    3) Most opt-algorithms have lost one or two dim-template-parameters
	    4) PDEInterface has lost dopedim as templateparameter.
08.05.2013: Added interface to IPOPT. 
11.04.2013: DOpElib is running with deal.II 8.0pre, updated
	    deprecated headers
10.04.2013: Added support to estimate the error in the CostFunctional for 
	    Optimization problems added. See OPT/StatPDE/Example1
07.02.2013: Changed Interface of RefineSpace of the MOL-SpaceTimeHandlers
21.12.2012: Removed the now unnecessary deal_II_dim > 1 checks for boundary and face integrals.
	    Now also in 1d we can use boundary equation ...
05.10.2012: Output handler now checks for nan and -nan values to assert that only nan is written in any case.
22.08.2012: OptProblemContainer and PDEProblemContainer now only evaluate Functionals
	    appearing in *Rhs if the type is required by the functional
12.07.2012: -Time stepping schemes rescaled. They now correspond to the scaling one 
	    	  would get using Galerkin-Methods in time.
	    -Removed Default setting in *Time*Explicit methods of the PDEINTERFACE.
	     Now, if not desired they do nothing (and need not be implemented).
	     In any other case user needs to write *Time*Explicit and write *Time* to 
	     do nothing.
Jun 2012  : Logo and Website have been created
09.05.2012: Backward-Time Loop is running

2. DOpE Meeting 3.5.2012-5.5.2012:
==================================
- Time stepping schemes rechecked for typos.
- Renamed optproblem.h to optproblemcontainer.h (OptProblem to OptProblemContainer)
- Initial Value Computation now done by DOpE, no longer the fixed dealii function project.
- Changed interface for incorporation of user defined dofconstraints: Dope computes always
   the hanging node constraints (for state and control), after that, the user specified dofconstraints
   (for state and control!) are added.
- DOpEWrapper::FiniteElement removed, use dealii::FESystem instead.
- Removed unnecessary template parameters SPARSITYMAKER and CONSTRAINTSMAKER.
- Removed common code from the timestepping schemes and moved it into the base classes ts_base and primal_ts_base. Moved the files containing the timestepping classes into the directory tsschemes
- Update the Apply...BoundaryValues to include other constraints, 
  like periodicity... (maybe with nonzero jump...). Also check the 
  condense(u)/distribute(u) stuff again, it should not be in the apply 
  boundary value stuff...	
- pdeinterface.h - scale_ico in CellEquation_U etc. implemented!
- It is now possible to use point-functionals as cost functionals. OPT/StatPDE/Example2 shows this. 

before 2.5.2012
-------------------------
- SVN in Heidelberg 
- Manual: Additional Chapter on what this Library does and why it is doing so.
- Multimesh: Support of vector valued FE.

---------------------------------------------

- Renamed statsolver and instatsolver: Now statreducedproblem and instatreducedproblem.
- Splitting of time discretization of state and control variables
- Precision for output of numbers added to outputhandler.
